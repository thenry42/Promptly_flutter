# What is Promptly ?

Promptly is a flutter app that allows you to chat with LLMs from multiple providers in a single place.

## Overview

This simple project provides a convenient way to communicate with various AI language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama, etc - all from one application. Simply configure your API keys and start chatting with your preferred AI assistants.

## Features

- Multiple AI provider support for chat & text generation
- Easy API key configuration (keys are encrypted and stored locally using the flutter SecureStorage package)
- Chat history is automatically saved between app launches

## Roadmap

- [x] Add support for OpenAI models
- [x] Add support for Anthropic models
- [x] Add support for Ollama (most models work out of the box)
- [x] Add support for DeepSeek models
- [x] Add support for Mistral models
- [x] Add support for Gemini models
- [ ] Ship the app on Mac, Linux, and Windows
- [ ] Add support for tool calling
- [ ] Add support for image input
- [ ] Add support for audio generation
- [ ] Add support for image generation

## Getting Started (Development Installation)

> This app is currently in development on Linux (Nobara 40). I'm working on adding support for other platforms, but it's not ready yet. I have not tested the app on any other platforms.

### Install Flutter & Docker

1. Install [Flutter/Dart](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
2. Run `flutter doctor` and install the missing dependencies for your device if any.
3. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
4. Run `make build` to build the Docker containers

### Install Promptly

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thenry42/Promptly.git
cd Promptly
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd frontend && flutter pub get
```

3. Run the application

```bash
cd .. && ./run.sh
```

> **Note:** You can add the desktop file to your applications menu to start the application faster. You need to adjust the Exec path to match your local path.

## Configuration

To use this application, you'll need to provide API keys for the LLM services you want to access:

1. Create an account with your preferred LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. Generate API keys from each provider's dashboard
3. Add the API keys to the application's configuration

## Privacy & Security

- All API keys are encrypted at rest using the flutter FlutterSecureStorage package
- All data is stored locally on the device
- Conversations may be processed by the respective LLM providers according to their privacy policies
- I cannot guarantee any misuses of API usage by the application. I personally use it at my own risk and so should you. I haven't add any issue so far but I would recommend to add API credits by small amounts to avoid any issues (recharge credits 5$ by 5$). Google does not provide that safety net, that's why I'm not using it.
